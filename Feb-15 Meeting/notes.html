<!--Notes talking about some CSS attributes-->
<!-- CSS Grid, the styling container, is columns and tell the container to arrange in a grid
    flexbox you style the actual elements.
    How does it know where to put something? It looks for block level elements and start trying to put everything
    in a box until you tell it do something different ( see line 16 in html/css)
    Can you force specific content into a specific box? Yes use the specific gridlines 
    More semantically correct to use an anchor tag and just style it to use a button. 
    Text align will center inline element. but can not position it.
    Anything with block->margin->padding  and text-> align->decoration 
    Modals :
